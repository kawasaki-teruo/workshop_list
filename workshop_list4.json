In a modern data architecture on AWS, you can store data in a data lake and use a ring of purpose-built data services around the lake allowing them to make decisions with speed and agility, at scale and with price/performance that is unmatched in the market.

Amazon Polly is an Amazon AI service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice. It currently includes dozens of lifelike voices in over 20 languages, so you can select the ideal voice and build speech-enabled applications that work in many different countries."
