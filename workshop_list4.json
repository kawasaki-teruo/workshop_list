It is not simply about integrating a data lake with a data warehouse, but rather about integrating a data lake, a data warehouse, and purpose-built stores, enabling unified governance and easy data movement. In a modern data architecture on AWS, you can store data in a data lake and use a ring of purpose-built data services around the lake allowing them to make decisions with speed and agility, at scale and with price/performance that is unmatched in the market. The workshops provided here will guide you through creating a modern data platform on AWS and will demonstrate the key principles, namely: Scalable Data Lakes, Purpose Built Data Services, Seamless Data Movement, Unified Governance, Performant and Cost Effective."

To solve these challenges, three main solutions are proposed: (1) Glue Spark code to flatten multi-level nested json data and enable to analyze of the IoT data as data frame format, (2) Apache Hudi to keep IoT sensor data up-to-date on a real-time basis, and (3) EventBridge, Lambda, and SNS to inspect IOT data schema change and send an alarm to users."

You will first learn how to create and connect into a Babelfish enable Aurora cluster. We will then touch on some internal structures of Babelfish, how it works behind the scene. You will learn limitations of Babelfish and techniques to overcome them. We will then move into migrating a real-world Microsoft SQL Server-based application called OrchardCMS. There is no better way to learn Babelfish than getting your hands dirty and doing an actual modernization! We will then investigate what it means to run a Proof of Concept (PoC) to a highly complex .NET application with a Microsoft SQL Server backend. We will use a real-world complex CMS application called DotNetNuke (aka DNN) & migrate it to Babelfish. During the labs, you will learn plenty of corner points, debugging techniques, helpful tools & surprises."

This workshop demonstrates cost-reduction steps in a sample architecture and shows ways you can identify and reduce compute costs in your environment using OpenCost, Kubecost, Karpenter, and AWS Graviton. Learn how AWS is collaborating with the OpenCost community to standardize cost tracking, allocation, methodologies, and measurements and help teams using Kubernetes easily understand their infrastructure costs."
